# anki_german

    Here, the user presents a .txt file with german verbs
    on each line to get back a json type anki deck that stores
    all the verbs with their conjugation and two different
    sentence examples in both german and english by default
    or french.

    This is no longer working because i've written this way back
    when i just started and i didn't save what versions were
    being used of python or other libiraries.
